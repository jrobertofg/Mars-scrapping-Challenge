# Mars-scrapping-Challenge
Scrap a page of mars


This project aims to analyze the weather data on Mars collected by the Curiosity rover. We will extract, clean, and analyze the data to answer several questions about the Martian weather.

## Files in the Repository

1. `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the initial steps for extracting Mars weather data from a given website.
2. `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the steps to extract weather data from a specific website, clean the data, convert it to a DataFrame, analyze it, and visualize the results.

## Steps to Run the Notebooks
 Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Internet connection
- Selenium
- bs4
- matplotlib.pyplot
- pandas


## Running the Notebooks
Open the Notebooks:

Open part_1_mars_news.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Open part_2_mars_weather.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
Execute the Cells:

Run each cell sequentially to execute the code. Follow the instructions in each notebook to understand the steps and processes.
Data Analysis Answers will be found in the notebooks
1. How many months exist on Mars?

2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?


3. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)?

To find the coldest and warmest months, we calculated the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months and plotted the results as a bar chart.

4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?

To determine this, we calculated the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months and plotted the results as a bar chart.

5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year?

The following visualizations in some questions were added:

Average Minimum Temperature on Mars by Month

Average Atmospheric Pressure on Mars by Month

Minimum Temperature on Mars over Time
